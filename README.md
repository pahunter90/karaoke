A simple mapping program for CIS322 at UO

Loads a map that gives the location of nearby pools.

Reads the pool addresses from a file, then displays them on the map.

The user is able to click on the markers and the address will display above the marker.

Additionally, clicking on an empty location on the map will change the location of the start marker
which starts at Autzen Stadium. The address of the marker will update as it is moved.

Lots of code used from previous CIS322 projects (credit Michal Young)

File name is pool.txt, but can be changed in flask_map.py

Happy swimming!
